# Ship it!

Congratulations! Your _TODO App_ is now completed.

It's now time to ship it to different stores and push the WASM version on a web site for everybody to appreciate it.

Few steps remains to publish to a store, like...

* Add more features - like a persistence of the todo list or a synchronization with a server
* Write down a marketing description for your app
* Create a better _Splash screen_  and application icons
* Provide screenshots for stores
* Translate your app and previous assets to many languages to increase your reach
* Setup a domain and an email

> ğŸš§ TODO: Finish assets for _final version_.
